# Fingerprints

Every site you build with **scroll-craft** gets one row here, appended after it
ships. The registry exists so your next build can prove it is a different page
rather than a re-skin of one you already made.

This file is **yours**. It starts empty on purpose: the gate is about not
repeating *yourself*, so it has nothing to say until you have built something.

The rules and the gate live in the skill's
`references/uniqueness.md`. Short version:

**A new build must differ from EVERY row below on at least 4 of the 6
dimensions.** Four against each row individually, not four on average across the
table. If a planned build fails, change the plan. Never edit a row to make room
for it.

The six dimensions are: **grammar**, **nav treatment**, **hero device**,
**act-sequence shape**, **close pattern**, **signature move**.

Dimension 6 is free, because a signature move is unique by definition. So the
gate really asks for three more out of the remaining five, and a build that
changes only grammar and world will fail it.

## The registry

| Build | Grammar | Nav treatment | Hero device | Act-sequence shape | Close pattern | Signature move | World | Port |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| campus-landing (2026-10-08) | Toybox: distinct scenes, illustrated, one pinned peak | Sticky app navbar kept; chip rail of six scene dots (right edge on desktop, bottom pill on phone), hides once listings take over | Three-plane sticker parallax with pointer lean, headline between planes | Pin hero (1.7) / flow chat / pin peak (3) / pan rail (2.4) / flow steps / flow iris close: 6 acts, about 9.3 viewport-heights | Iris reveal into a primary panel, then the live listings grid continues below | The tidy-up: ten scattered blobs morph into their category shapes and drop onto real shelves that show live counts | Illustrated M3 Expressive shapes, Material 3 Fidelity palette from #7C3AED | Vite + React route `/` |

## What is taken

Add a bullet here whenever a build claims something a later build should avoid
reusing: a grammar, a nav treatment, a close pattern, a signature move, an
act-count-and-length band. The shared columns are what the next build inherits
as a constraint, so writing them down is the whole point.

- **Toybox grammar** (playful illustrated scenes, one pinned peak, no scrub). campus-landing.
- **Scroll-driven shape morph that sorts objects into slots** (the tidy-up). campus-landing.
- **Scene-dot chip rail** that swaps from a right-edge column to a bottom pill on phones. campus-landing.
- **6 acts at about 9.3vh**. campus-landing.

## Appending a row

After shipping, add one line to the table and one bullet to **What is taken** if
the build claimed something new. Fill every column. Say what the build shares
with existing rows.

Rows are append-only. A build that has been superseded stays in the table,
because the space it occupies is still occupied.

## Worked example

The skill's author kept a registry of twelve builds across eight page grammars.
If you want to see what a filled-in table looks like, and which shapes tend to
collide, read `EXAMPLES.md` in the scroll-craft repository. Treat it as
illustration only: those rows are somebody else's builds and they do **not**
constrain yours.
